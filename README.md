# Emacs Application Framework (EAF)
EAF is a GUI application framework that revolutionizes Emacs graphical capabilities to ultimately *Live in Emacs*.

## EAF Application Overview
EAF is an extensible framework, one can develop any Qt5 application and integrate it into Emacs.

## EmacsConf2020 - Extend Emacs to Modern GUI Applications with EAF
- EAF talk & demo at EmacsConf2020, presented to you by [MatthewZMD](https://github.com/MatthewZMD)
- Homepage (Q&A included): https://emacsconf.org/2020/talks/34/
- Youtube link:

[![EmacsConf2020 - Extend Emacs to Modern GUI Applications with EAF](https://img.youtube.com/vi/HK_f8KTuR0s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK_f8KTuR0s)

## Install
1. Download EAF
```Bash
git clone --depth=1 -b master https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework.git ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/
```

Alternatively, you can use a [Quelpa recipe](https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa)
```Emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(eaf (:fetcher github
               :repo  "manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework"
               :files ("*"))))
```

2. Install EAF dependencies using `M-x install-eaf-dependencies`.

If you prefer to manually call the installation script in the terminal,

- If you use GNU/Linux,

```Bash
cd emacs-application-framework
chmod +x ./install-eaf.sh
./install-eaf.sh
```

- If you use Windows,

```shell
cd emacs-application-framework
node ./install-eaf-win32.js
```

Feel free to inspect the install script yourself. An explanation of each dependency can be found at [Dependency List](#dependency-list).

3. Install Elisp packages:
- [emacs-ctable](https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-ctable)
- [emacs-deferred](https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-deferred)
- [emacs-epc](https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-epc)
- [s.el](https://github.com/magnars/s.el)

4. From here on, you can either add the full path to the EAF installation directory to your Emacs ```load-path```, then add the following to `init.el`:

```Elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/")
(require 'eaf)
```
or, if you use [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package), you can use the following *sample* configuration for your convenience.

```Elisp
(use-package eaf
  :load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework" ; Set to "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/eaf" if installed from AUR
  :init
  (use-package epc :defer t)
  (use-package ctable :defer t)
  (use-package deferred :defer t)
  (use-package s :defer t :ensure t)
  :custom
  (eaf-browser-continue-where-left-off t)
  :config
  (eaf-setq eaf-browser-enable-adblocker "true")
  (eaf-bind-key scroll_up "C-n" eaf-pdf-viewer-keybinding)
  (eaf-bind-key scroll_down "C-p" eaf-pdf-viewer-keybinding)
  (eaf-bind-key take_photo "p" eaf-camera-keybinding)
  (eaf-bind-key nil "M-q" eaf-browser-keybinding)) ;; unbind, see more in the Wiki
```

## Wiki

It is **highly** suggested to read the [Wiki](https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/wiki) first before using EAF.

Wiki consists of documentations on:
* Keybindings
* Customization
* Design
* TODOLIST

There also are some helpful tips to make EAF work with Docker, Helm, etc.

## FAQ

### How does EAF work?
EAF implements three major functionalities:
1. Integrate PyQt program window into Emacs frame using QWindow Reparent technology.
2. Listen to EAF buffer's keyboard event flow and control the keyboard input of PyQt program via Python EPC.
3. Create a window compositer to make a PyQt program window adapt Emacs's Window/Buffer design.

Learn more from the [Wiki](https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/wiki/Hacking)!

### EAF vs EXWM?
1. EAF and EXWM share a common goal: enhance collaboration between the standard GNU Emacs with other GUI tools.
2. EXWM is an X11 Window Manager, it manages and controls other software using a keyboard, but it cannot modify, customize and extend the behavior of other software.
3. EAF is *not* a Window Manager, it utilizes the windows managing capabilities of Emacs to display its applications.
4. The intention of EAF is to provide a framework to write PyQt5 applications that extends the multimedia experience of Emacs. From the perspective of Emacs' buffer/mode design, EAF is not different from any other package, with the former uses Qt for drawing contents while the latter uses Emacs' built-in text libraries instead.
5. Through EAF's design, one can use Elisp to control Python and vice versa, and even able to use Elisp to control JavaScript in EAF Browser. EAF enables Emacs to the world of **multi-language scripting**.

Both projects are similar in terms of interface, but they are two completely different projects with different goals in mind. Sometimes one may find EAF is more suitable than EXWM, sometimes it's the other way around. Please do not meaninglessly compare them.

### EAF can't works on MacOS. Why?
1. Qt5's QGraphicsScene technology does not work on MacOS.
2. QWindow Reparent technology need use the original API of Mac platform for replacement.

If you've figure them out, PRs are always welcome!

### EAF js-video-player can't play some video on Windows. Why?
`js-video-player` requires that qtwebengine built against ffmpeg to support proprietary codecs like `h264/aac`.

### Why doesn't EAF receive input events on WM?
EAF confirms that the desktop environment or window manager you can work includes: KDE, GNOME2, GNOME3, Mate, Xfce, LXDE, I3, QTILE, Xpra.

We suspect there are some issues with how all the Window Managers implement their x11 protocols.

One workaround is to name of command `wmctrl -m` to the elisp list `eaf-wm-focus-fix-wms`. Fill an issue if it still doesn't work.

### Proxy
If you need to use proxy to access internet, one can configure the proxy settings.

```Elisp
(setq eaf-proxy-type "http")
(setq eaf-proxy-host "127.0.0.1")
(setq eaf-proxy-port "1080")
```

If you use Socks5 as local proxy, one can set proxy type with:

```Elisp
(setq eaf-proxy-type "socks5")
```

## Report bug

### For any installation and configuration assistance, please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/wiki) first!

If you encounter a problem with EAF, and it occured after pulling the latest commit, please check the [Discussions](https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/discussions/527) page first.

For any other problems, please use `emacs -q` and load a minimal setup with only EAF to verify that the bug is reproducible. If `emacs -q` works fine, probably something is wrong with your Emacs config.

If the problem persists, please report it [here](https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/issues/new) with `*eaf*` buffer content, it contains many clues that can help us locate the problem faster.

If you got segfault error, please use the following way to collect crash information:
1. Install gdb and turn on option `eaf-enable-debug`
2. Use command `eaf-stop-process` stop current process
3. Restart eaf, send issue with `*eaf*` buffer content when next crash
