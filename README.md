  <br>A free/libre and open-source extensible framework that revolutionizes the graphical capabilities of Emacs, <br>the key to ultimately <i>Live in Emacs</i>
</p>

## Vision
Emacs, the extensible *text editor*, is more than 45 years old. It is older than virtually all operating systems people use today, almost as old as the first UNIX system. During the decades of development, the world's brightest hackers have contributed their intelligence and creativity, together they've constructed the most comprehensive and richest ecosystem that you can find in any software to date.

If you are a hacker who works with numerous languages and text, who's keyboard-driven and desires maximum freedom, extensibility, and introspectivity over your tool, maybe to the extent of *living* in it, Emacs will be your best bet.

Unfortunately, this 45 years of age is also one of the greatest disadvantages of Emacs. Comparing with modern software, Emacs lacks performance, specifically Emacs Lisp lacks performance, it doesn't have proper multithreading and its graphical capabilities are seriously limited. It is far from what you'd expect on every GUI application today (such as IDEA or VSCode). You may think that Emacs, as a text-centric editor, doesn't need them, but have you ever run into a situation that, you sit comfortably typing commands and doing your Emacs sorcery, but can't stop to ponder:

    What if Emacs has a real browser?
    What if this PDF or video file can be viewed efficiently without leaving Emacs?

Emacs, although infinitely extensible in text, is very limited in graphics. It shouldn't have to be this way. However, Emacs Lisp is *the* integral part of the Emacs culture, it carries decades of history with itself, it is what makes Emacs special. It is irreplaceable.

The vision of the Emacs Application Framework (EAF) project is that, while fully retaining the rich history, culture and ecosystem of Emacs and Emacs Lisp, to open up completely new doors to the ecosystems of Python, Qt5, and even JavaScript. EAF extends Emacs to the world of modern graphics, but still preserving the extensibility and customizability of Emacs, it will be the key to ultimately *Live in Emacs*.


## Applications

EAF is very extensible, it already comes with a number of useful applications by default:

| Browser                                          | PDF Viewer |

## Install
#### 1. Download EAF

```Bash
git clone --depth=1 -b master https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework.git ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/
```

#### 2. Install/Update EAF applications and dependencies

You can use `M-x eaf-install-and-update` or manually run the `install-eaf.py` script in the EAF directory:

```Bash
cd emacs-application-framework
chmod +x ./install-eaf.py
./install-eaf.py
```

There are many useful flags available for `install-eaf.py`, check it yourself using `--help`.

#### 3. Load EAF Core

From here on, you can either add the full path to the EAF installation directory to your Emacs ```load-path```, then add the following to `init.el`:

```Elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework/")
(require 'eaf)
```

- If you use virtual/conda environment, or you simply want to use `python3` instead of `python` executable, you might want to set `eaf-python-command` to something like `/usr/bin/python3/`.
- Alternatively, if you use [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package), you can use the following *sample* configuration for your convenience.

    ```Elisp
    (use-package eaf
      :load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-application-framework" ; Set to "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/eaf" if installed from AUR
      :custom
      ; See https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework/wiki/Customization
      (eaf-browser-continue-where-left-off t)
      (eaf-browser-enable-adblocker t)
      (browse-url-browser-function 'eaf-open-browser)
      :config
      (defalias 'browse-web #'eaf-open-browser)
      (eaf-bind-key scroll_up "C-n" eaf-pdf-viewer-keybinding)
      (eaf-bind-key scroll_down "C-p" eaf-pdf-viewer-keybinding)
      (eaf-bind-key take_photo "p" eaf-camera-keybinding)
      (eaf-bind-key nil "M-q" eaf-browser-keybinding)) ;; unbind, see more in the Wiki
    ```

#### 4. Load EAF Apps

You can use below code to load applications `browser` and `pdf-viewer` that you installed, please check [Applications](https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework#applications) for the full list:

```Elisp
(require 'eaf-browser)
(require 'eaf-pdf-viewer)
...
```

#### 5. Hooray!

Congratulations, you just installed EAF! You can try `M-x eaf-open-demo` (that is if you have `demo` installed, of course) to see if everything works properly. If the demo is installed but isn't launching, check the EAF buffer (`*eaf*`) to begin diagnosing the problem with your installation. 

I **highly** encourage you to read the [Wiki](#Wiki) and [FAQ](#FAQ) if you have any questions.

Also, you should regularly `git pull` **and** run `install-eaf.py` (`M-x eaf-install-and-update`) to update EAF, its applications, and relating dependencies. If you encounter a bug while using it, see the instruction on how to [Report bug](#report-bug).

Enjoy the new possibilities of Emacs!

## Wiki

It is **highly** suggested to read the [Wiki](https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework/wiki) first before using EAF.

The wiki consists of documentations on:
* Keybindings
* Customization
* Design
* TODOLIST

There also are some helpful tips to make EAF work with Docker, Helm, etc.

## FAQ

### How does EAF work?
<p align="center">
  <img style='height: auto; width: 100%; object-fit: contain' src="./img/framework.png">
</p>

EAF implements three major functionalities:
1. Integrate PyQt program window into Emacs frame using QWindow Reparent technology.
2. Listen to EAF buffer's keyboard event flow and control the keyboard input of the PyQt program via Python EPC.
3. Create a window composite to make a PyQt program window adapt Emacs' Window/Buffer design.

Learn more from the [Wiki](https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework/wiki/Hacking)!

### EAF vs EXWM?
1. EAF and EXWM share a common goal: enhance collaboration between the standard GNU Emacs with other GUI tools.
2. EXWM is an X11 Window Manager, it manages and controls other software using a keyboard, but it cannot modify, customize and extend the behavior of other software.
3. EAF is *not* a Window Manager, it utilizes the windows managing capabilities of Emacs to display its applications.
4. EAF intends to provide a framework to write PyQt5 applications that extends the multimedia experience of Emacs. From the perspective of Emacs' buffer/mode design, EAF is not different from any other package, with the former uses Qt for drawing contents while the latter uses Emacs' built-in text libraries instead.
5. Through EAF's design, one can use Elisp to control Python and vice versa, and even able to use Elisp to control JavaScript in EAF Browser. EAF enables Emacs to the world of **multi-language scripting**.

Both projects are similar in terms of interface, but they are two completely different projects with different goals in mind. Sometimes one may find EAF is more suitable than EXWM, sometimes it's the other way around. Please do not meaninglessly compare them.

### macOS
Currently, macOS is only partially supported and needs a lot of testing, not all functions can work normally, please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework/wiki/macOS) for details.

### Browser crashes
Please DO NOT install PyQt5 through pip, pip version has a bug, please install PyQt5 from the OS software repository.

### Why doesn't EAF receive input events on Linux Window Manager?
EAF confirms that the desktop environment or window manager you can work with includes: KDE, Gnome2, Gnome3, Mate, Xfce, LXDE, Sway, i3, QTile, Xpra, EXWM.

We suspect there are some issues with how all the Window Managers implement their x11 protocols.

One workaround is to name of command `wmctrl -m` to the elisp list `eaf-wm-focus-fix-wms`. Fill an issue if it still doesn't work.

### Proxy
If you need to use a proxy to access the internet, one can configure the proxy settings.

```Elisp
(setq eaf-proxy-type "http")
(setq eaf-proxy-host "127.0.0.1")
(setq eaf-proxy-port "1080")
```

If you use Socks5 as a local proxy, one can set proxy type with:

```Elisp
(setq eaf-proxy-type "socks5")
```

Customize rule proxy please check [Wiki](https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework/wiki/Customize-Rule-Proxy)

## Report bug

### For any installation and configuration assistance, please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework/wiki) first!

If you encounter a problem with EAF, and it occurred after pulling the latest commit, please check the [Mandatory Procedures to Keep Your EAF Up-To-Date](https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework/discussions/527?sort=new) page **first**.

For any other problems, please use `emacs -q` and load a minimal setup with only EAF to verify that the bug is reproducible. If `emacs -q` works fine, probably something is wrong with your Emacs config.

If the problem persists, please report it [here](https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework/issues/new) with `*eaf*` buffer content, it contains many clues that can help us locate the problem faster.

If you get a segfault error, please use the following way to collect crash information:
1. Install gdb and turn on option `eaf-enable-debug`
2. Use the command `eaf-stop-process` to stop the current process
3. Restart eaf, send issue with `*eaf*` buffer content when next crash
