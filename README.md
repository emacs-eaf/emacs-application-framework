# What is Emacs Application Framework?
Emacs Application Framework is a development framework, where developers can develop any PyQt program, and integrate it into Emacs.

This framework mainly implements three functions:
1. Integrate PyQt program window into Emacs Frame using Xlib Reparent technology
2. Listening to EAF buffer's keyboard event flow and controlling the keyboard input of PyQt program via DBus IPC
3. Created a window compositer to make the PyQt program window adapt Emacs's Window/Buffer design

Using this framework, you can use PyQt to develop powerful GUI programs to extend Emacs.

### Or run EAF with docker

If you prefer to run linux in a docker, you can read [Run EAF with docker](./docker/README.md)

### Why this awesome framework doesn't works with MacOS?
There are mainly three obstacles:
1. I can't make dbus/python-dbus works on MacOS High Sierra
2. This framework need use X11 reparent to stick Qt5 window to emacs frame, but i don't know how to make X11 works on MacOS.
3. Qt5 QGraphicsView/QGraphicsScene can't work MacOS, specify QGraphicsVideoItem can't work.

Please check [Key binding](./docs/KEYBINDING.md) to check keybinding of application.

```
NOTE:
EAF use DBus' session bus, it must running in general user.
Please don't run EAF with root user, root user just can access DBus's system bus.
```

## Settings

### Customization
You can easily configure variables that EAF Python side uses with the Emacs Lisp function `eaf-setq`. Check the full list of configurable variables with `C-h v eaf-var-list`.
#### EAF Camera
The default directory to store images taken by EAF Camera is `~/Downloads`. To change it, put the following in `.emacs`
```Elisp
(eaf-setq eaf-camera-save-path "~/Downloads")
```
### Proxy
If you can't access most awesome internet services like me, you perhaps need proxy settings like below:

```Elisp
(setq eaf-http-proxy-host "127.0.0.1")
(setq eaf-http-proxy-port "1080")
```

Then EAF browser is free! ;)

### Markdown Previewer
If you use markdown previewer, you need access to a [Personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=), fill something in "Token description" and click button "Generate token" to get your personal token, then set token with code:

```Elisp
(setq eaf-grip-token "yourtokencode")
```

Otherwise, github will popup "times limit" error because so many people use grip. ;)

## FAQ

### Why not support Wayland?
EAF use X11 XReparent technology to stick Qt5 window on Emacs buffer area, Wayland not support XReparent.

I recommend you use KDE, it's stable enough and support X11 XReparent technology.

### "undefined symbol" error
If you got "undefined symbol" error after start EAF, and you use Arch Linux, yes, it's a bug of Arch.

You need use pip install all dependences after you upgrade your Arch system, then undefine symbol error will fix.

## Report bug
If you have any problem with EAF, please use command "emacs -Q" to start Emacs without any customizations.

Then re-test your workflow. If "emacs -Q" works fine, it's must be something wrong with your emacs config file.

If the problem persists, please [report bug here](https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/issues/new).
