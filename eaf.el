;; Emacs application framework

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put eaf.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'eaf)
;;
;; No need more.

;;; Customize:
;;
;;
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET eaf RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2018/06/15
;;      * First released.
